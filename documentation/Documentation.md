# Abstract

As the last assignment of LAPR3, we have developed a project in java to support the management of a ride-sharing business. The software allows the users to rent bicycles and electric scooters with different technical features resorting to various route suggestions for their trip, including the shortest and most energically efficient routes. It is possible for the administrators to create, update and remove parks, bicycles, eletric scooters, interest points and paths with or without wind information. Furthermore, it is possible to check the available slots in a park, the bicycles and eletric scooters in a park, that charging status of every electric scooter in a park, the closest parks to the user, the distance that the user is to a park, obtain the route between two parks and calculate a projection of the calories burnt in a trip between two parks.

## Resources

In order to offer a solution to the problem statement, we used the tools and resources learned in various curricular units of the semester:

- **ESINF** ( _Information Structures_ ): We learned how to efficiently use graphs and binary search trees in the programming language ``Java``.
- **BDDAD** ( _Databases_ ): We learned how to model data and develop database with ``SQL`` and ``PLSQL``, to efficiently manipulate the data.
- **FSIAP** ( _Applied Physics_ ): We learned the behavior of electricity.
- **LAPR3** ( _Scrum Module_ ): We learned the best practices for the Scrum agile project development and how to use ``Jira``, a software used in project management.
